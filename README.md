Oaktyres test

For this test we want you to recreate a view using react, for styling you should use pure css or sass.
This is what the react application should look like

For the data, you can find it at https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2. The JSON attributes required are the name, tagline, and image_url. This will be used to create an array of JSX card elements as seen on the web page.
To make the API call you can use Axios

This page must contain 2 number input elements which can be seen at the top of the page that when altered change the data pulled from the API. This can be figured out by looking at the pagination section of the punk API documentation
